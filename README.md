# Psalm plugin for Laravel

![Type coverage](https://shepherd.dev/github/psalm/laravel-psalm-plugin/coverage.svg)

## Installation

First [install Psalm](https://psalm.dev/quickstart) in your project, making sure to run `--init`, then run the following commands:

```
composer require --dev psalm/plugin-laravel
vendor/bin/psalm-plugin enable psalm/plugin-laravel
php ./artisan config:clear
```

## How it works

Under the hood it just runs https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper and feeds the resultant stubs into Psalm. It also uses a couple of function return type providers, but nothing special.
